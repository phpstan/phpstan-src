## Contributing

Any contributions are welcome.

### User requirements

Before using this software please proove that you have at least once swam in the icy Vltava River https://youtu.be/PCbftc95pVk?t=40

### Building

PHPStan's source code is developed on PHP 8.0. For distribution in `phpstan/phpstan` package and as a PHAR file, the source code is transformed to run on PHP 7.1 and higher.

Initially you need to run `composer install` in case you aren't working in a directory which was built before.

Afterwards you can either run the whole build including linting and coding standards using

```bash
make
```

### Running development version

You can also choose to run only part of the build. To analyse PHPStan by PHPStan itself, run:

```bash
make phpstan
```

### Fixing code style

To detect code style issues, run:

```bash
make cs
```

And then to fix code style, run:

```bash
make cs-fix
```

### Running tests

Run:
```bash
make tests
```

### Debugging

1. Make sure XDebug is installed and configured.
2. Add `--xdebug` option when running PHPStan. Without it PHPStan turns the debugger off at runtime.
3. If you're not debugging the [result cache](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/result-cache), also add the `--debug` option.

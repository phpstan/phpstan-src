 * The 'new' section contains function/method names from FunctionSignatureMap (And alternates, if applicable) that do not exist in php8.0 or have different signatures in php 8.1.
 *   If they were just updated, the function/method will be present in the 'added' signatures.
 * The 'old' signatures contains the signatures that are different in php 8.0.
 *   Functions are expected to be removed only in major releases of php.
